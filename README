Whizzy little scripts I write for fun, mostly to help with research, in Python 2.7. 

All scientific modules imported in the scripts, as well as python 2.7, can be downloaded 
in the Anaconda package, https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/


CONTENTS OF WHIZZY_SCRIPTS:

clean_ports.py -- Selfupdates macports, checks for inactive ports, and uninstalls inactive 
ports. Note that this program assumes that macports is installed. I don't know what would 
happen if you tried to run this without having macports installed.

dump_columns.py -- Dumps two columns from a FITS file into an ASCII/txt/dat file.

fits_info.py -- Prints HDU information, extension 1 header keywords, and extension 1 
column names for a given FITS file. Using extension 1 here for RXTE event-mode data.

get_keyword.py -- Gets the value of a keyword from a FITS header.

obs_epoch_rxte.py -- Determines the observational epoch of a specific RXTE observation.
Can also tell you the total observation time of a list of observation files.
Be careful with this one, it's barely tested.
